## **Hi, I'm Simon** 👋

After travelling the world and working remotely for several years, I wanted a new career challenge. As a Doctor of Chemistry, friends suggested using my skills to break bad, but instead I chose to learn code.

I've been learning full-stack JavaScript development at School of Code, a brilliant UK-based online bootcamp, since April 2022 👨‍🎓

From August 2022, I'll be seeking job opportunities as a junior developer 👨‍💻

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-partridge-06819951/), [GitHub](https://github.com/simonpartridge86), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simonisworking)

<!-- Add paragraph about why I was attracted to coding. See interview answers for inspiration-->

<!-- Also add links to #100daysofcode repo and SoC diary repo -->
