# Hi, I'm Simon - thanks for stopping by ü§ó

I‚Äôm a Doctor of Chemistry and former copy editor. After travelling the world and working remotely for the last 10 years, I‚Äôve started a new adventure in the programming world.

In August 2022, I completed a full-stack JavaScript development bootcamp run by the brilliant [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) üë®‚Äçüéì

I'm now seeking job opportunities as a full-stack developer üë®‚Äçüíª
